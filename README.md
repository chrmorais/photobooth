This is a little experiment to explore the possibilities of the getUserMedia and canvas APIs in JavaScript. It allows to live edit your webcam feed and take screenshots. That's all.

(Only tested in Google Chrome. Requires webcam to work.)

Things to do:
---

* fallback to using images if webcam is notd available 
* add more effects
* add descriptiond
* make canvas drawing code more flexible
* speed up canvasdrawing code

Third party libraries used in this project:
---

* [jquery](http://jquery.com)
* [require js](http://requirejs.org/)
* [js signals](http://millermedeiros.github.io/js-signals/)
