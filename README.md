this is a little experiment to explore the possibilities of the getusermedia and canvas apis in javascript. it allows to live edit your webcam feed and take screenshots. that's all.

tested in chrome, firefox and opera. requires webcam to work. may be slow.

things to do:
---

* make canvas drawing code more flexible
* fallback to using images if webcam is not available 
* add more effects
* add inline documentation
* speed up and optimize drawing code
